```{r}
library(summarytools)
library(ggplot2)
```

The original dataset was provided by the Government of Colombia, specifically the Victim's Unit ([UARIV](http://www.unidadvictimas.gov.co) in Spanish). The summary of the dataset can be found online. That dataset we will be working with contains much more detail. 

After loading that dataset into R.

```{r}
data <- read.table('data/source/140812_UARIV_RNI_CONSULTA_EDADES.txt', 
                   header = T, 
                   sep = ';')

nrow(data)

```

The dataset, containing **4537455** observation, is divided in **11** variables.


We also load the Colombia boundary data into R: 

```{r}
admin3 <- read.csv('data/boundaries/admin_3.csv')
admin2 <- read.csv('data/boundaries/admin_2.csv')
```
